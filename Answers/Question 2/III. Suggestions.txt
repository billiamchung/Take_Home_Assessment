III. Suggest changes that should be done in order to support any data type (as opposed to only an int data type)

- This can be done easily by slightly modifying the Node class that is provided to us.
- All we have to do is change the int member of the Node class to an Object in order to support a greater range of data types like so:

[OLD]
public class Node {
    Node left;
    Node right;
    int num;
}

[NEW]
public class Node {
    Node left;
    Node right;
    Object obj;
}

By doing this, we allow Node to hold any data type as its value. Depending on the data type, we would have
to serialize/deserialize the tree differently than we would do with an ordinary int.
